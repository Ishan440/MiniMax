# MiniMax
Games based on low level AI algorithm MiniMax 
In this project, I aim to implement mini-max a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, and stastics
using trees as data structures to make predict the winner of a game (Stonehenge or Chopsticks), given any state of the game. 
I'll be using trees as a data structure.
Skills learnt:
Different ADTs
Python programming
Class Hierarchies
